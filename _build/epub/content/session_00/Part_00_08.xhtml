<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This free course, <em>Grammar matters</em>, has introduced you to a particular way of understanding grammar, focused on what language <em>does</em>, rather than on what it* is*. Because it is concerned with grammar as a way of making meaning (i.e. what it does), a functional approach to grammar can be particularly useful for understanding how language works in real-world contexts. Additionally, you’ve seen that the expanded view of meaning proposed by Halliday and other SFL scholars, which takes into account
the ideational, interpersonal and the textual dimensions, enables a functional grammar approach to be used as a tool for intervening to address communicative issues in people’s lives. You’ve learned, for example, about how the insights of SFL can be applied to legal and educational contexts.</p>
<p>We hope this free course has given you more insight into the relevance of grammar to everyday and professional life, and has gone some way towards convincing you that grammar matters.</p>
