    "In previous sections of this course you have seen how a functional understanding of grammar can apply to a wide range of contexts. In this section, you will see how a functional approach, and particularly SFL, is being applied in a professional context, in this case secondary education. Shortly, you will learn about the work going on in an inner-city school in Birmingham, UK, to use functional grammar to improve student learning and achievement in their school subjects such as PE and Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, however, it will be useful to introduce a particular aspect of grammar called ‘nominalisation’. This has been identified by functional linguists as an important feature of academic and scientific language, but one that can make scientific texts hard for learners to understand and produce scientific writing. The term will be explained as you work through the activity."

    "1. You may have commented that the first sentence is more likely to have come up in spontaneous, informal, face-to-face conversation, where someone is telling a personal story to someone they know quite well. The second describes a similar event but seems to come from a weather report or some other scientific record of the event, and was probably written rather than spoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are a number of features you may have pointed out here. A key difference is in the way that information is packaged in each case. In the first sentence, a lot of the information is conveyed through the verb groups and adverb groups *got muggy really quickly* and *came down cats and dogs*, the noun groups are simple (e.g. made up of one pronoun) and there are two clauses linked by *and*. In the second, there is only one clause and one verb group *was followed*, which conveys information about the sequencing of events but not about what actually happened. Most information is instead conveyed through the noun groups *A rapid rise in humidity* and *heavy precipitation*. This can be shown as follows:\n",

    "This feature often seen in scientific and academic texts is called nominalisation. You saw a good example of it in Activity 9. __Nouns__ and __noun groups__ can be used to package meanings about entities in the real world – things or persons like mangoes, bluebottles, windowpanes, schoolgirls and clouds (often called concrete nouns). However, we can also use __noun groups__ to talk about processes and qualities. If someone is leaving, for example, we can talk about their *departure*, and if they are feeling frustrated, we can talk about their *frustration*. *Departure* and *frustration* are both nouns, but they are not really ‘things’ in the way that a bluebottle or a windowpane is (they are often called abstract nouns). Nominalisation is the use of a noun to represent a process or quality. Through nominalisation, it becomes possible to pack into one noun group a number of meanings that might otherwise be expressed using __verb groups__ and __adverb groups__."

In technical fields this is particularly useful, since so much activity revolves around measuring, comparing and ordering."

    "In the next activity you will watch a video (which lasts 20 minutes). You’ll see two classes – physical education (PE) and science. The school where the action takes place is Hamstead Hall Academy, an inner-city school in Birmingham. Hamstead Hall is a secondary comprehensive school (pupils are aged 11 to 18 years) with a diverse school population. Fifty per cent of the pupils have an English as an Additional Language background and prior academic attainment on entry is, on average, significantly below the national average.\n",

    "In the PE lesson, you will hear some terminology which comes from SFL and which has not been introduced in this course. The teachers are recapping a previous lesson and are using the concepts of ‘macro theme’ and ‘hyper theme’ to remind students of how to organise what they write at the whole text level as well as within individual paragraphs. You should not need an in-depth knowledge of these terms to make sense of what is going on here. This approach of giving students a metalanguage – that is language to talk about language – to help to scaffold their understanding of how language works is typical of the Hamstead Hall initiative. You may also have noticed that this is also the approach taken in this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In both classrooms you will also see examples of how students are being supported to use nominalisation to make their writing more scientific. The focus is partly on the lexical element – vocabulary – but also on the grammatical element of nominalisation and the way in which lexical choices and grammar patterns work alongside each other in technical and scientific writing. Aside from the classroom sequences, the video features the teachers talking about their experience of making language more central to their teaching and why and how the school developed a language and learning policy. The teachers you will hear from include Mark and Lee, two PE teachers who you will see co-teaching a lesson, and Alistair Clarke, a science teacher who you will also briefly observe. In addition, you will hear from Eileen Mawdsley, the assistant head, and Helen Handford, a literacy and language consultant to the school."

It is characterised by its fatness and a narrow shoulder, wide hip-frame composition. Endomorphs are suited to power events, such as sumo wrestling. This is as a result of their additional body fat causing an increase in overall body weight and therefore greater difficulty in being pushed out of the ring by opponents.’ *;\n",

This is because they are fatter, which causes them to weigh more, making it more difficult for their opponent to push them out of the ring.’ *;\n",

    "__EILEEN MAWDSLEY (ASSISTANT HEAD OF SCHOOL, LANGUAGE AND TEACHING):__ *As a school, we felt we needed to develop a whole-school language-development policy for a variety of reasons, really. And whilst English results were very good at GCSE, we had history results that weren’t reflective of ability, PE, science. And we tried to analyse that, as a school, and figure out precisely what it was. *;\n",
    "*And we felt it was the language and literacy side of their understanding; and for teachers, as well, because they were teaching science or history, but not addressing the language. And knowledge is realised through language, and you’ve got to prove what you know through the language you use. And so we felt we needed to delve into the language much more deeply, that what we were doing was really quite superficial. So that’s what made us look at it across the school. *;\n",

    "__ALISTAIR CLARKE:__ *–that would be a ‘negative correlation’. What if it was ‘the more fuel you put in your car’ … Sorry. What if it was ‘the less fuel you put in your car, the less far it will travel?’ *;\n",
    "\n",
    "__EILEEN MAWDSLEY:__ *As we’ve worked with this approach to language we’ve discovered, in terms of the impact, that one of the most powerful outcomes is the children are able to take control of the language they’re using and understanding. This, for us, was one of the drawbacks, if you like, of the previous approach to literacy that we’d had. You know, things like ‘writing frames’ sentence structures, which have their place, but they can also be quite limiting. *;\n",
    "*For part of what we were trying to achieve was the most able children, you know, getting to As and A*s, achieving the very, very top grades, and any child getting to the best level they possibly could. And you can’t do that, if you’re relying on a formula, if you like. So what we wanted to do was to give them something that would enable them to control language for themselves, to be independent, to be autonomous, so they have a whole repertoire of language skills, and whatever context they’re in, they are able to select language appropriately – and that might be an exam answer in a GCSE exam, it might be a presentation in a classroom, it might be outside of school. *;\n",
    "*So, for us, we don’t want to limit it to just exam results; it’s about beyond that: the communicators they’ll be when they’re adults, and having that foundation and that understanding of how language works, so they can present what they know articulately and clearly, in the best way for any context they happen to be in. And we’ve seen the difference it makes in terms of their control of language, but also the progress they’re making in subjects; because now they control the language, they control the knowledge and they present that in the right way in different situations. So we’ve seen the progress increase massively. *;\n",
    "\n",
    "__ALISTAIR CLARKE:__ *[IN CLASS] It’s not about one increasing and the other one increasing. It could be about one variable decreasing and the other one decreasing. That’s still positive. It’s about the direction of the changes: if they’re both changing in the same direction, both going up, it’s positive; both going down is also positive. *;\n",
    "\n",
    "__HELEN HANDFORD (EDUCATION CONSULTANT):__ *So one thing that I’ve observed both in my time as a teacher in school, but also then later as a trainer and a consultant, is that when it comes to literacy and language development, we tend to dabble in some things. So we’ll take on one kind of intervention for a while, maybe do that for a year, and then we’ll try something else, and then we’ll try something else. *;\n",
    "*And what they’re doing at Hamstead Hall is different to that, because they are not dabbling. They’ve decided to stick with this approach, because they understand that, in order for you to make strides in equipping children with the academic language that they need, that takes time. It’s an incremental process. *;\n",
    "*And we’re into, now, our third year. And I would say that teachers now are starting to say, at the start of year three, ‘Hmm, didn’t quite get it in the first year; struggling in the second year’, and now, they say things like ‘I’m starting to understand, and I’m starting to see the point of this.’ So we feel like we’re making headway. *;\n",
    "*And we’re on a long journey. So although you’ve got this very long journey equipping teachers with more knowledge about language and honing their own language skills, and acquiring a metalanguage, you’ve also got along the way flashes of immediate improvement within that you can see amongst learners, and that is really, you know, heartening. *;\n",
    "\n",
    "__EILEEN MAWDSLEY:__ *We are aware that some people feel that this kind of approach might inhibit creativity for children. It’s the complete reverse of that, because it gives them the tools through which they can be creative. Because, they might want to be creative, but if you don’t know how language works, if you can’t draw upon a repertoire of language skills, then how can you realise that creativity? It stops. There’s a brick wall there. *;\n",
    "*Whereas now they’ve got the tools, and they’ve got this whole range of language, ideas and skills, then they can call upon them whenever they wish, in whatever way they want to be creative. *;\n",
    "*And it also helps them to be critical thinkers as well, because what we present them to read, they can interrogate it, because they understand how texts work; they can understand, you know, the structures of the whole text, of the paragraphs, of the sentences. And because they can do that, they can understand better what a writer is doing and how a writer might be manipulating ideas. So it allows them to interrogate and come to their own conclusions much better, as well. So in all kinds of ways, they’re more independent. *;\n",

    "1. There are certainly a number of very positive claims made in the video about this approach. In particular you may have noticed head teacher Eileen Mawdsley’s emphasis on how the approach has enabled students to take control of language for themselves and to be independent autonomous communicators who can judge how to use language in different contexts, both inside and outside school. Eileen was also particularly insistent that, by becoming more aware of how language works, rather than students losing their creativity or criticality, the inverse occurs. On the down side, it’s clear that this kind of approach requires teachers of different subjects to really take on board their responsibility for teaching children to write in their subject. This seems to involve a new mindset and considerable training, meaning that the whole approach may take a long time to fully embed in a school.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You may be able to recollect experiences at school where you felt you understood some of the concepts being taught, but found it hard to express these in a scientific manner. Perhaps the technical vocabulary in some subjects put you off. The Hamstead Hall example provides evidence that difficult language issues across the entire school curriculum needn’t be such a barrier. The idea that PE teachers, for example, would be engaged in supporting students’ literacy, may seem radical but there is a lot of evidence that it is not helpful for schools to leave language learning and development only to the English department.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This example is school-focused, but it does show that attention to grammar and language awareness can be of great use in a range of different areas of human activity and knowledge. If we extend this notion to the later stages of education and training – to university studies, professional and vocational training and beyond – it is not difficult to see how awareness of grammar can play a central part in our communicative lives at home, in the community and at work.\n",
